## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Solar Powered**: Utilizes photovoltaic panels and a thermal heating chamber.
- **Thermal Desalination**: Heats and evaporates water, leaving behind salts and impurities.
- **Multi-Stage Filtration**: Includes sediment, pre-carbon, RO membrane, and post-carbon filters.
- **PLC Automation**: Monitors and controls water flow, temperature, and pump operations.
- **Battery Backup**: 12V rechargeable system enables off-grid operation.
- **Low Maintenance**: Designed for minimal manual intervention and easy scalability.

## 🧪 Working Principle

1. **Solar Collection**: Solar panels generate and store energy using an MPPT charge controller.
2. **Heating & Evaporation**: DC-powered heating element vaporizes the impure water.
3. **Condensation**: Vapor condenses on a cool surface into clean distilled water.
4. **Filtration**: Condensed water passes through a 4-stage filtration system.
5. **Automation**: PLC ensures continuous operation based on real-time sensor data.
