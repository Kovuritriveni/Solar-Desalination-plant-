Solar Desalination Plant with PLC-Based Monitoring and Control
🌍 Project Overview
This project aims to address the global challenge of water scarcity through a sustainable, off-grid, and automated solar desalination system. It integrates solar thermal technology and PLC-based automation to convert saline or impure water into clean drinking water, making it suitable for deployment in rural, coastal, and arid regions.

⚙️ Key Features
Solar Powered: Utilizes solar photovoltaic panels and a thermal heater to evaporate water using renewable energy.

Thermal Desalination: Heat-induced evaporation and condensation eliminate salts and impurities.

Multi-Stage Filtration: Involves sediment, carbon, RO, and post-carbon filters for enhanced water quality.

PLC Automation: A Delta PLC ensures efficient monitoring and control of the entire purification process.

Off-Grid Capable: Operates independently with battery-backed solar power, ideal for areas without electricity.

Low Maintenance: Simple filter replacement and minimal manual intervention.

🧪 Working Principle
Solar Collection: Sunlight is captured by solar panels and stored in a battery using MPPT charge control.

Heating & Evaporation: Stored energy powers a DC heating element to boil impure water.

Condensation: Steam is condensed into pure water, leaving behind salts and heavy metals.

Filtration: The condensed water passes through multi-stage filters to remove remaining impurities.

Automation: A PLC automates water flow, heating, and system monitoring for reliable performance.
